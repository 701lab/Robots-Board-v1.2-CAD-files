## What is Robots board v1.2?
 
**Robots board v1.2** is a cost affective board to implement small differential drive robots, for example, balancing robot. It uses _stm32g071cbu_ MCU, _DRV8848_ motor driver to control two small BDC motors, _ICM-20600_ 3-axis gyroscope and accelerometer, and _NRF24l01+_ as a radio module. Board support motors with incremental encoders and has a connector for UART communication.

## This repo contains
Autodesk Eagle CAD files for robots board v1.2 with schematics and PCB for a single board and PCB files for a pannel of 4 boards with 100x96mm (so it can be ordered as a pannel from chines manufacturers for a small price).

Open source **setup software for the board** can be found [here](https://github.com/701lab/rbv1.2-implementation).
